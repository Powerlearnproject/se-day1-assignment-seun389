#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance of software applications.
It is important in the technology industry because it enables the development and production of secure ,reliable and efficient softwares which satisty the users' need. Without it, developing such would be difficult, if not totally impossible. 


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

 1. Development of programming languages: Programming languages will FORTRAN were developed
 2. Institution of software engineering discipline: This happened inthe 1960s.
 3. The advent of structured programming : Modular and resuable codes writing was introduced.
 4. The rise of Agile Methodologies: Agile methodologies which involves iteration in the stages of software development life cycles were introduced.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

  1. Design: This is the first stage. It involves the design of the digital solution based on the user's requirement.
  2. Implementation: Here, the coding is done. The soultion is wriiten in a language that the computer can understand.
  3. Testing: The software is tested to find out if it contains any error. Here, correction/debugging takes place if any error is found. 
  4. Deployment: The stage is the one in which the software is made avaiable for use to user(s) it is made for. 
  5. MAintenance: The software is supported in the form of improving it based on new trends, or removing bugs discovered during its use in the course of time, after it has been deployed.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Comparism:
Both are software development methodologies. And the software will go through all the stages of software development in both.

Contrast:
Waterfall Methodologies is that in which there is a flow of work from up down the developmental stages, just as waterfalls occurs in the real world. There are no iteration in the course of the development betweeen stages.

While Agile Methodologies involves the repetition in the flow of works among the stages of software development so that there may be a return to the design stage after testing several times before proceeding to the deployment stand and so on.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

  1. A software Developer writes the code for the software application to be produced.
  2. A Quality Assurance Engineer makes sure the software is of good quality by testing it well.
  3. A Project Manager monitors the whole process of sofware development and sees to it that it is appropriately delivered to the end user.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Intergrated Development Environments are applications that enable to write , and test and debug software codes. e.g. Visual Studio Code, Eclipse.

Version Control Systems helps in tracking changes made in the process of software development codes. E.g. Git, AWS CodeCommit

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

1. Changing requirement: Requirements may change in the cause of the production.
2. Short Deadlines: The deadline being short may cause the production to be rushed resulting in software's quality compromise.
3. Technical Debt: This is the cost incur because of having to redo a work because it wasn't initially well done, due to the use of shortcuts and the likes

   Strategies to overcome this include: proper communication and agreement on the software requirement, time managemnent and agile methodologies among others.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit testing: this has to do with the testing of individual component of the software separately.
2. Integration: This has to do with testing between components or sub systems.
3. System: This is the form of testing that is carried out on a the software as a whole at once.
4. Acceptance: This is done to verify whether or not the software developed meets the user's requirement.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompted engineering has to do with crafting questions or queries to be given to AI models in such a way that it will help the model to give a desired or better answer or result.
It is important in interracting with AI Models because without it, the AI bModel will not be able to give a result tailored to or suited to the user's need. The result will to general in nature. It usually helps the Models to understand better the context of the user as well as the intentions of the request made of it, so that it can serve the user better and more efficiently.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Example of a vague prompt:
What does a student that is getting enrolled into a school need?

Example of an improved prompt:
What are the things a 11 years old student need to get in preparation for a high school in Nigeria?

The improved prompt is more effective because it gives the particulars of the age, geographical location, and the category of school the student wants to get enrolled. This better sets the context of the expected answer and will hence make it more effective.
